Sandbox to play around with AI/ML concepts and APIs in Python

## Terms

Feature - Input data  
Label - Output data

## ML Algorithms

- Linear regression
    - Used for predicting continuous values
    - Assumes linear relationship between input features and output labels
    - Great when data is roughly linear
    - Sucks when data isn't linear

- Random Forest
    - builds a ton of decision trees
    - each tree makes a prediction
    - final result is either the average predication of all the trees (regression task) or the majority vote (classification task)
    - Great for data with complex relationships or non-linear data
